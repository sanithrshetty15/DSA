1️⃣ What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
It must be finite, clear, and produce output.

2️⃣ Algorithm vs Program

Algorithm = Logical steps to solve a problem.
Program = Implementation of an algorithm in a programming language.

3️⃣ Big-O Notation

Big-O measures how an algorithm grows with input size.

O(1) — Constant Time

Execution time does not depend on input size.

O(n) — Linear Time

Execution time grows linearly with input size.

O(n²) — Quadratic Time

Execution time grows proportional to square of input.

O(log n) — Logarithmic Time

Execution time grows slowly by dividing problem size repeatedly.

4️⃣ Rules of Big-O

** Ignore constants

** Keep the dominant term

** Focus on worst-case growth
